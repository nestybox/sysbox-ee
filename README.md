## Introduction

**Sysbox Enterprise Edition** (Sysbox-EE) is the enterprise version of the
open-source [Sysbox container runtime](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox),
developed by [Nestybox](https://www.nestybox.com).

Sysbox-EE uses Sysbox at its core, but adds enterprise-level features such as:

*   Improved container isolation / security

*   Running more types of system-level workloads inside containers

*   Scalability (running more containers per host)

*   Significant performance and efficiency optimizations (for faster container deployment with reduced disk utilization)

*   Lifecycle (higher release cadence, critical bug fixes ASAP)

*   Nestybox professional support with a guaranteed SLA (rather than best effort on Sysbox)

*   Feature prioritization (Sysbox-EE feature requests are prioritized)

For these reasons, **we recommend that enterprises that wish to use Sysbox in
their IT infrastructure use Sysbox-EE**.

Sysbox-EE is a drop-in replacement for Sysbox. It installs and it's used in the
exact same way, but includes the enterprise level features described above. On a
given host however, either Sysbox or Sysbox-EE must be installed, never both.

See the [next section](#features--pricing)for a comparison between Sysbox-EE and
Sysbox (aka Sysbox Community Edition).

## Features & Pricing

Sysbox-EE is offered via a 30-day free trial and a paid subscription after that.

Features and pricing info is shown below.

<p align="center">
    <img alt="sysbox" src="./docs/figures/sysbox-features.png" width="1000x" />
</p>

You can download Sysbox-EE for free and use it during the free trial period.

Afterwards, we ask that you contact Nestybox for [pricing and payment information](https://www.nestybox.com/pricing).

If you have questions, you can reach us [here](#contact).

## Supported Distros

Sysbox-EE relies on functionality available only in relatively recent Linux kernel
releases.

See the [distro compatibility doc](docs/distro-compat.md) for information about
the supported Linux distributions and the required kernel releases.

We plan to add support for more distros in the near future.

## Host Requirements

The Sysbox host must meet the following requirements:

*   It must be running of the [supported Linux distros](docs/distro-compat.md).

*   We recommend a minimum of 4 CPUs (e.g., 2 cores with 2 hyperthreads) and 4GB
    of RAM. Though this is not a hard requirement, smaller configurations may
    slow down Sysbox-EE.

## Installation

Sysbox-EE is a drop-in replacement for Sysbox, meaning that it's installed and
used in the same way.

For this reason, the documents in the [Sysbox repo](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/tree/master/docs)
apply equally to both Sysbox and Sysbox-EE.

Here are the links to the docs showing how to install Sysbox-EE:

*   [Installation on Docker hosts](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/blob/master/docs/user-guide/install-package.md#installing-sysbox-enterprise-edition-sysbox-ee)

*   [Installation on Kubernetes Clusters](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/blob/master/docs/user-guide/install-k8s.md#installation-of-sysbox-enterprise-edition-sysbox-ee)

## Using Sysbox-EE

Once Sysbox-EE is installed, you create a container using your container manager
or orchestrator (e.g., Docker or Kubernetes) and an image of your choice.

Docker command example:

```console
$ docker run --runtime=sysbox-runc --rm -it --hostname my_cont registry.nestybox.com/nestybox/ubuntu-bionic-systemd-docker
root@my_cont:/#
```

Kubernetes pod spec example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubu-bio-systemd-docker
  annotations:
    io.kubernetes.cri-o.userns-mode: "auto:size=65536"
spec:
  runtimeClassName: sysbox-runc
  containers:
  - name: ubu-bio-systemd-docker
    image: registry.nestybox.com/nestybox/ubuntu-bionic-systemd-docker
    command: ["/sbin/init"]
  restartPolicy: Never
```

You can choose whatever container image you want, Sysbox-EE places no requirements
on the image.

Refer to the [Documentation](#documentation) section below for further examples
on how to use Sysbox-EE.

## Documentation

The following documents in the [Sysbox repo](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/tree/master/docs)
show how to use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy containers with Sysbox.

These docs apply equally to both Sysbox and Sysbox-EE.

Features that are specific to Sysbox-EE are tagged with **"Sysbox-EE Feature
Highlight"** in the docs.

*   [Sysbox Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/blob/master/docs/quickstart/README.md)

    *   Provides many examples for using Sysbox to deploy enhanced
        containers. New users should start here.

*   [Sysbox User Guide](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/blob/master/docs/user-guide/README.md)

    *   Provides more detailed information on Sysbox features and troubleshooting.

*   [Sysbox Distro Compatibility Doc](docs/distro-compat.md)

    *   Distro compatibility requirements.

In addition, the [Nestybox blog site](https://blog.nestybox.com) has articles
on how to use Sysbox to deploy containers.
