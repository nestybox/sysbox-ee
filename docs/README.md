# Sysbox-EE Documentation

Sysbox-EE is a drop-in replacement for Sysbox, meaning that it's installed and
used in the same way.

For this reason, the documents in the Sysbox repo apply equally to Sysbox-EE.

Features that are specific to Sysbox-EE are tagged with **"Sysbox-EE Feature
Highlight"**.

Features that appear in a particular Sysbox release are flagged in the docs with
the release tag (e.g., "**\[ v0.1.2+ ]**" indicates the feature appeared in
Sysbox release v0.1.2 and beyond).
