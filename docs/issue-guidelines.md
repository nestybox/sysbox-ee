Guidelines for Filing Issues
============================

Issues can be filed [here](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox-external/issues)

Please follow these guidelines when filing issues with Sysbox.

1) Create an issue with one of the following labels:

* `Bug`: for functional defects, performance issues, etc.

* `Documentation`: documentation errors or improvements

* `Enhancement`: Feature requests

* `Question`: for questions related to usage, design, etc.


2) Add a label corresponding to the Sysbox release (e.g. `v0.1.0`)

3) Include information about the host's Linux (e.g., `lsb_release`, `uname -a`).

4) Describe the issue as clearly and completely as possible.

5) Tell us how to best reproduce it.

We appreciate when our users report issues. Nestybox will try to
address them ASAP. We will mark them as `fixed`, `invalid`,
`duplicate`, or `wont-fix`.

Thanks for helping us improve Sysbox!
