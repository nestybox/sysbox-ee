Guidelines for Filing Issues
============================

The following are guidelines for filing issues with Sysvisor.

1) Create an issue with one of the following labels:

* `Bug`: for functional defects, performance issues, etc.

* `Documentation`: documentation errors or improvements

* `Enhancement`: Feature requests

* `Question`: for questions related to Sysvisor's usage, design, etc.


2) Add a label corresponding to the Sysvisor release (e.g. `v0.1.0`)

3) Describe the issue as clearly and completely as possible.


Nestybox will try to address issues ASAP. We will mark them
as `fixed`, `invalid`, `duplicate`, or `wont-fix`.
